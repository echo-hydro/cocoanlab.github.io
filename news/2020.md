<b><span style="font-size: 20px !important; color: #0055A9;">Jaejoong's first first-author paper has been published at <i>Journal of Clinical Neurology</i></span></b>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">Paper title: "Individual-Level Lesion-Network Mapping to Visualize the Effects of a Stroke Lesion on the Brain Network: Connectograms in Stroke Syndromes"</span>

<span style="font-size: 15px !important; color: #555;">Two years ago, our lab started a collaborative project with Prof. Jaesung Lim, MD, PhD on the functional connectivity changes in stroke patients. Jaejoong provided his expertise in fMRI data analysis, including preprocessing, functional connectivity analysis, and connectogram visualization, and Dr. Lim wrote the paper based on the analysis results. This collaboration has been really fruitful, and Wani has been enjoying working with Dr. Lim. We are currently collecting and analyzing large-scale, multi-site stroke fMRI data, which will greatly help understand and predict the functional outcomes of stroke patients based on their functional connectivity patterns. Thus stay tuned.</span>
