<b><span style="font-size: 20px !important; color: #0055A9;">2019 Cocoan's SWOT and BIG questions</span></b>

### Strengths
- We have expertise in pain/emotion research, in interpreting predictive models within the context of neuroscience
- Computational resources (well-equipped)
- Strong analysis methods and techniques; advanced computational skills
- Lab members have diverse backgrounds 
- Wani is enthusiastic about research; ambitious and passionate Wani
- No administrative job for students
- Easy to collect new data and test new ideas
- Independence 

### Weaknesses
* Independence again, a small number of collaborations going on within the lab; not enough intergroup discussions, lack of inter-lab collaborations
* not many experts in the lab (e.g., no postdocs), and our group is already big (a bottleneck exists)
* We’re "users" of computational methods, not developers, though sometimes we could want to develop new things
* We do not have a strong reputation yet; uncertain about future outcomes
* We’re from diverse fields; could be superficial about things
* A majority of projects are at the same stage (the “analysis” phase)
* Each research has different perspectives and goals; difficult to be integrated into one big picture

### Threats
* Each project takes long time, while the field is changing rapidly; difficult to catch up
* Data—storage and computational resources
* Analysis tools are changing too rapidly
* Difficult to know what is going on at the center of the field

### Opportunities
* We're a part of a big center; we can easily collect large data and have an access to good computing resources
* Collaborations with many other researchers with different modalities can be possible
* Clinical applicability
* Growing field! our field are getting attention; many people are flowing into the field
* We’re addressing challenging research questions; opportunity for new discovery
* Good networking in the field 


### BIG questions 

#### that We ARE asking:
* Can we accurately measure pain and emotions through the brain; what is the upper bound of model performance?
* Can we make brain models of emotions, affects, and concepts that are subjective and abstract?
* Dissociating different components of pain
* Investigating within-individual factors (e.g., cognitive factors) that influence pain
* Building personalized models of pain and emotions
* real-life pain and emotions

#### that we WILL be asking
* (we ended this lab activity with the promise that we will keep thinking about this question, what are the big questions that we will be asking!)
